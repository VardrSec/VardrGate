# VardrGate MVP

## Goal

Give a security engineer or developer a single API call that answers the question:

> "Does this endpoint respect its authorization boundary?"

No agents, no UI, no persistence. One HTTP call in, one structured answer out.

## The MVP workflow

```
1. Engineer writes a test case JSON file
2. POST /tests/execute
3. Read findings in the response
```

That is the entire workflow. VardrGate does not store results, manage projects, or orchestrate test suites. Those concerns belong upstream of this service.

## Supported test scenario at MVP

**Horizontal access control check (unauthorized object access)**

An engineer has two or more identities with different permissions on the same resource. They want to confirm that lower-privileged or unrelated identities cannot access it.

### Concrete example

- `owner` — user who created the resource; expected to receive 200
- `other_user` — authenticated user who does not own the resource; expected to receive 403
- `anonymous` — unauthenticated caller; expected to receive 401 or 403

If `other_user` or `anonymous` receives a 2xx, VardrGate emits an `unexpected_access` finding.

## What the MVP does not cover

| Concern | Reason not in MVP |
|---|---|
| `potential_bola` classification | Requires resource-ownership model (owner identity, target tenant, object ID) not yet built |
| Response-body comparison in findings | `compare` package exists but is not wired into the engine yet |
| Concurrent execution | Sequential per-identity execution is correct and sufficient at this scale |
| Persisted results | Out of scope; callers store what they need |
| Vertical privilege escalation | Requires role hierarchy model not yet built |

## Inputs at MVP

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | Caller-supplied test identifier |
| `identities[].id` | Yes | Unique within the test case |
| `identities[].credential` | Yes | `bearer`, `api_key_header`, or `static_header`; `value` is write-only |
| `identities[].name` | No | Human label for findings and logs |
| `identities[].role` | No | Descriptive; not used in evaluation logic yet |
| `identities[].tenant_id` | No | Stored on the identity; not used in evaluation logic yet |
| `request.method` | Yes | Any valid HTTP method |
| `request.url` | Yes | `https://` target; `http://` allowed; private IPs blocked by default |
| `request.headers` | No | Applied to every identity's request |
| `request.query_params` | No | Merged with URL query string |
| `request.body` | No | JSON body forwarded as-is |
| `expected_access[].identity_id` | Yes | Must match an identity in the same test case |
| `expected_access[].decision` | Yes | `allow`, `deny`, or `skip` |

## Outputs at MVP

- `executions` — one entry per identity: status code, observed outcome, response headers, duration, error
- `findings` — zero or more: category, severity, confidence, identity, message, evidence, timestamp

## Observed outcome values

| Value | HTTP status |
|---|---|
| `allow` | 2xx |
| `deny` | 401, 403 |
| `not_found` | 404 |
| `redirect` | 3xx |
| `server_error` | 5xx |
| `client_error` | 4xx (other than 401, 403, 404) |
| `error` | Network failure, timeout, URL validation error, body too large |

## Finding conditions at MVP

| Category | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `unexpected_access` | expected `deny`, observed `allow` |
| `authorization_mismatch` | expected `allow`, observed `deny` |

No finding is emitted for: execution errors, `skip` decisions, or ambiguous outcomes (404, 5xx, 3xx, client_error) when the expected decision is `deny`.

## Security constraints on targets

- Only `http` and `https` schemes accepted
- Loopback and RFC-1918 private ranges blocked by default
- Link-local, multicast, and unspecified addresses always blocked
- DNS rebinding prevented via custom `DialContext` (resolve → validate → dial in one step)
- Set `ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true` only for local lab use

## Definition of done for MVP

- [ ] `POST /tests/execute` returns correct findings for allow/deny mismatches
- [ ] Credential values never appear in responses, findings, or logs
- [ ] Private and loopback targets blocked by default
- [ ] Tests green, vet clean, gofmt clean
- [ ] `examples/ownership_check.json` demonstrates the primary workflow
